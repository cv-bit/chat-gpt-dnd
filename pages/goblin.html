<!-- goblins: Act 1: The Setup The players are introduced to the world and their
characters, and they learn about the group of goblins that have been causing
trouble in the area. The players may be hired by a town or village to deal with
the threat, or they may simply decide to take on the challenge themselves. The
players will need to gather information about the goblins and their habits, as
well as gather resources and allies to help them in their quest. Act 2: The
Confrontation The players set out to confront the goblins, facing various
challenges and obstacles along the way. They may need to traverse treacherous
mountains, brave dark forests, or navigate other dangerous terrain. As they get
closer to the goblins' hideout, they may encounter goblin minions or other
enemies that are working for or with the goblins. Act 3: The Showdown The
players finally reach the goblins' hideout and must engage in a final, epic
battle to defeat them. The goblins may use their cunning and numbers to try to
overwhelm the players. The players will need to use all of their skills and
resources to emerge victorious. If they succeed, they will be hailed as heroes
and may earn rewards or other benefits from the town or village that was
threatened by the goblins. -->

"Goblin's Grotto" "The Goblin King's Curse" "Goblin Apocalypse" "Into the
Goblin's Lair" "Goblin's Gambit" "The Goblin's Gauntlet" For the campaign
involving goblins, here are a few NPC ideas: A sly rogue who claims to have
insider information about the goblin's plans and is willing to sell it to the
players. A fierce warrior from a neighboring village who is eager to join the
players and defeat the goblins. A mad hermit who lives in the forest and may
have encountered the goblins, but is not entirely reliable. A charismatic leader
of the goblins who the players may be able to negotiate with or attempt to
defeat in single combat. And here are a few ideas for encounters that the
players might have while pursuing the goblins: A trap-filled dungeon that the
goblins have boobytrapped, requiring the players to use their skills to avoid or
disarm the traps. A swarm of giant spiders that the goblins have allied with and
must be fought off. An ambush by the goblins in a narrow mountain pass, forcing
the players to fight for their lives. A goblin-infested village that the players
must clear out before they can continue their pursuit. A pair of boots that
allow the wearer to move stealthily, making it easier to sneak up on goblins. A
set of throwing daggers that always find their mark, no matter how far away the
target is. A magical shield that can deflect attacks from goblin weapons, making
it easier to defend against them. A potion that allows the drinker to understand
and speak the goblin language, which could be useful for negotiating or
gathering information. The goblins had been causing chaos in the region for too
long, stealing from villages and causing destruction. The people were fed up and
needed someone to put a stop to it. The players are hired by a town to deal with
the goblin threat, and so they set out on their quest. They gather information
and resources, and face various challenges and obstacles along the way.
Eventually, they reach the goblins' hideout and must engage in a final, epic
showdown to defeat the mischievous creatures and bring peace back to the land. A
goblin-infested mine that the players must clear out before they can continue
their pursuit. A haunted forest where the goblins have set up a temporary base,
and where the players may encounter other supernatural threats. A goblin market
where the players can try to gather information or trade for supplies. A ruined
castle that was once home to a powerful lord, now abandoned and overrun by
goblins.
