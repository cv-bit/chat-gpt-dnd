<!-- dragon: Act 1: The Setup The players are introduced to the world and their
characters, and they learn about the dragon that has been terrorizing a nearby
town. The players may be hired by the town's leaders, or they may simply decide
to take on the challenge themselves. The players will need to gather information
about the dragon and its habits, as well as gather resources and allies to help
them in their quest. Act 2: The Confrontation The players set out to confront
the dragon, facing various challenges and obstacles along the way. They may need
to traverse treacherous mountains, brave dark forests, or navigate other
dangerous terrain. As they get closer to the dragon, they may encounter minions
or other enemies that are working for or with the dragon. Act 3: The Showdown
The players finally reach the dragon's lair and must engage in a final, epic
battle to defeat it. The dragon may have powerful abilities and may summon other
creatures to fight alongside it. The players will need to use all of their
skills and resources to emerge victorious. If they succeed, they will be hailed
as heroes and may earn rewards or other benefits from the town or other grateful
parties. -->

"Dragon's Lair" "The Dragon's Shadow" "Dragonslayer" "The Dragon's Hoard"
"Dragonfire" "The Dragon's Den" Sure! Here are a few NPC (non-player character)
ideas for the campaign involving a dragon: A wise old wizard who has studied
dragons for decades and may have useful information for the players. A brave
warrior who has faced the dragon before and is willing to join the players on
their quest. A greedy merchant who is willing to sell the players supplies, but
at a steep price. A noble lord who is willing to offer a reward for the defeat
of the dragon, but may have ulterior motives. And here are a few ideas for
encounters that the players might have while pursuing the dragon: A group of
trolls blocking the players' path, forcing them to find a way around or defeat
the trolls to continue. A treacherous mountain pass that requires the players to
use their climbing skills to navigate, while also avoiding rockslides and other
dangers. A pack of worgs (wolf-like creatures) that are hunting the players and
must be defeated or outsmarted. A tribe of ogres that are willing to let the
players pass if they can prove their strength in a test of combat or other
skills. A sword that is imbued with dragonfire and deals extra damage to dragons
and other dragon-type creatures. A set of gauntlets that give the wearer
resistance to dragon breath attacks. A wand that allows the user to cast a spell
to charm dragons, potentially turning them into allies. A cloak that grants the
wearer the ability to fly, which could be useful in fighting a dragon or
reaching the dragon's lair. The dragon had been terrorizing the region for
months, destroying villages and hoarding treasure. The people were desperate for
a solution, and so they turned to a group of brave adventurers. The players are
hired by the town's leaders to defeat the dragon and bring peace back to the
land. They set out on their quest, gathering information and resources, and
facing various challenges and obstacles along the way. Eventually, they reach
the dragon's lair and must engage in a final, epic showdown to defeat the beast
and emerge victorious. A mountain fortress where the players can seek shelter
and rest while they plan their assault on the dragon's lair. A hidden valley
where the players can find rare herbs and other resources that may be useful in
their quest. A ruined city that was destroyed by the dragon, where the players
may find clues or treasure. A magical portal that transports the players to
another realm, where they may encounter powerful allies or enemies.
